## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Crimson (#DC143C) to embody energy, strength, and determination, aligning with the user's call for red in the palette.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5DC) to provide a neutral backdrop that ensures readability and allows the vibrant reds and accent colors to stand out.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) as an accent to evoke feelings of prestige and history.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, providing an elegant and high-end feel. Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability.
- Use clean, modern icons, primarily in gold, to complement the site's color scheme. Icons should be related to political campaign themes and subtly animated on hover.
- Employ a full-screen layout with sections clearly defined by smooth transitions and scrolling effects. Utilize negative space to ensure content is not overwhelming.
- Subtle, scroll-triggered animations throughout the site, including parallax effects, morphing elements, and liquid transitions. Ensure animations respect 'prefers-reduced-motion' setting.
